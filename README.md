# Getting Started with Employee List

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This Employee List is a web application built using React and Bootstrap. It provides a user-friendly interface to manage employee data, including viewing, adding, and deleting employees. Users can filter employees by department or search for employees by name.

## Setup Instructions

To set up and run the application locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/alissacheng/employee-mgmt.git`
2. Navigate to project directory: `cd employee-mgmt`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm start`
5. Open application: Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

## Usage

- Upon opening the application, you will be presented with the dashboard displaying a list of employees.
- To add a new employee, click on the "Add Employee" button in the navigation bar and fill in the required details in the form.
- To delete an existing employee, click on the delete icon next to the employee's information under "Actions". A popup will appear asking you to verifiy that you want to delete the employee you have selected.
- You can filter employees by department using the dropdown menu provided in the top left corner. Remove the filters by toggling the checkmarks in the dropdown menu or by clicking the cancel filter button below the search bar.
- To search for a specific employee by name, use the search bar located at the top of the dashboard. Your search results will populate immediately while you are typing. You can search by first name, last name or full name.

## Technologies Used

- React: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- Bootstrap: Front-end framework for designing responsive and mobile-first websites.
- JavaScript: Programming language used for the application logic.
- HTML/CSS: Markup and styling languages for structuring and styling the application interface.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
